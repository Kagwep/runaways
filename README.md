## About

Runaways is a gaming project that combines the thrill of evading capture with the excitement of collecting and growing unique digital assets.


### How does it work?

TokenBound is used to create a token-bound account for each player's Genesis Runaway. This account is bound to the player's genesis runaway nft token and is used to store and manage their gaming assets, including offspring runaways, Skins, and Outfits.

 ### Tools used
  
  - An ERC-6551 account/registry implementation
  - tokenbound-connector


## Gameplay

### Experience Points

- Earn experience points by actively playing the game.
- Use experience points to grow your Genesis Runaway and unlock new ones.

### Runaway Creation

- Create new Runaways by having at least three existing Runaways.
- Each offspring creation drops experience points.

### Skins and Outfits

- Create, trade, or sell Skins and Outfits with unique characteristics and rarity.


The TokenBound account is responsible for interacting with the smart contracts when:

Upgrading and Updating Runaways' experience.
Managing Sales: Facilitating the buying and selling of Runaways, Skins, and Outfits between players.
Acquiring New Runaways: Enabling players to purchase new Runaways or acquire them through gameplay.
